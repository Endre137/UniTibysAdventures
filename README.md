# UniTiby's adventures - Interactive learning game
## Description
The application I developed is a 2D RPG learning game. The main purpose of the game is to help students learn the basics of the C programming language.
The protagonist of the game is a university student named UniTiby; 'Uni' refers to the university, and 'Tibi' is a Hungarian first name.
His name is very similar to 'Unity,' a development platform that I also used to develop the game. The scripts are written in the C# programming language. 
In the game, players must solve labyrinths by answering questions at crossroads, with each answer representing a path. 
All chapters begin with a lesson containing the necessary information to solve the given labyrinth.
